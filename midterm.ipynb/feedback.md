# Notes on the Midterm

* _Correctness    (out of 40):_ 30
* _Good Practices (out of 10):_ 9
* _Docs / Testing (out of 10):_ 3

_Details on the grading criteria for the midterm can be found on [Canvas](https://canvas.slu.edu/courses/28045/rubrics/23671)._

I noticed that you named your folder `midterm.ipynb` instead of just `midterm`.  You can change those even after you've created them. That was a littel confusing.

Because you forgot docstrings and tests on most of the functions, I deducted 7 points under _Docs / Testing_.


## Step 1
* Nice work.
* Remember to remove your `print` statements that you used for debugging, though.
* It would have been good to have a description in the docstring of what the function does / what it's purpose is.

## Step 2
* Nice work, but you forgot your docstrings.

## Step 3
* I like the use of '%A' to get a meaningful day of week.
* You forgot your docstrings here.
* From a style perspective, mixing variable naming conventions (some mixed upper/lower case and others lowercase) isn't good form.
* This function should have used your previously defined `get_rate` function instead of copying over all the logic again. I've deducted 1 point for this from _Good Practices_.

## Step 4
* I don't see a solution at all for part 4. I've deducted 10 points from _Correctness_.
