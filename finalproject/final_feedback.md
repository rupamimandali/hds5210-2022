# Feedback on Final

Overall, I think you did a good job demonstrating most of the skills we learned this semester.
1. One of the requirements was to merge data sets together. I didn't see that in your project.
2. One of the requirements was to use functions to abstract or encapsulate logic. I didn't see that except in your definition of "column_select"... twice. I don't htink tha function really had much value, though.
